<p style="font-size: 20px; background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> 
                 We started as a small local company, with a few hundred dollars to our name. We lived out 
            in the country side so we were able to house many abandoned pets that we found. Paying for 
            all these animals was extremely difficult. We gave them any scraps and we would walk around to 
            local stores asking for any scraps of food they could afford to give us. Unfortunately, we knew
            many animals would not be there for long since they had medical issues that we would not be able
            to afford to get medicine for, but we would not put them down, we gave them the best life we could before
            they passed on.. After a while, a family stopped by asking if they could look at the
            animals to pick a pet for there daughter. We didn't set a price on them or even had a plan to charge 
            them but they gave us $100 as a donation for what we were doing. With that money we bought as many bags 
            of food as we could as well as some small toys for them. The dogs and cats didn't get along at first as 
            they were brought in from the streets and there survival instincts were up but after a couple weeks they 
            began to get along and they even took in new strays as there own.

 <p style="font-size: 20px; background-color: lightblue; font-weight: bold;">

    Word got out of what we were doing and people wanted to help us. Some by volunteering, and others by adopting pets 
    and paying, even though we still didn't charge for them. In about a year there were only a few animals left in our 
    small property. We decided to expand our search area farther and farther to bring in as many strays as we could. We 
    had people bringing in strays and soon we had a local animal hospital look at the strays with medical issues for free.
    We were extremely greatful for this and we could no believe what we had been able to accomplish. We got onto a local newspaper 
    and then a larger newspaper that stretched out further. From there we blew up. Hundreds of people wanted to volunteer and many
    more donated. We were overwhelmed with the amount of support and we began expanding our little area for all strays
    we could take. We then decided it was time to expand even further, and thats how we came to be.
