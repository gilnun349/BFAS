                        equipment that enables her to stand up and even scoot around. She’s quite a good little swimmer
                        too.
                        Lemon’s favorite past times include cuddling, swimming, preening, eating, and standing in her
                        stand aid or scooter (The Lemobile), and cuddling some more.

                        been easy for this smiling angel. Her jaw has been broken in 3 places and never fixed. Trixie
                        was used for breeding by someone who feed her “when he remembered” … most of her meals were
                        found in the garbage bags that covered the front lawn.
                        April 8, 2012 was the day Kristen Vilardi “rescued” this little senior girl and the day the
                        battle started for her to live a happy, healthy, long life. The battle continued but Trixie had
                        Kristen and a whole community fighting along side her…with no intention of losing.
                        On October 7, 2012 Trixie put up a good fight but she just couldn’t fight anymore. She passed

                        But she doesn’t let this stop her! Bunny was born to a South Central LA rescue named Mima. Mima
                        was too ill and emaciated to produce milk for the puppies, so Bunny and her two siblings were
                        bottle fed from the day they were born every 2-3 hours. One of Bunny’s siblings did not survive,
                        but the other, a perfectly healthy puppy named Piggly Wiggly was adopted.</p>

                        Snow White is a ridiculously sweet 6 year-old who came into the city shelter, in February 2012,
                        when her owner was charged with animal cruelty and neglect. She sat in her cage for 3 months, as
                        evidence, until the courts determined she would be taken away from her owner permanently. Safe
                        Humane Chicago’s Court Case Dog Program employees met Snow White in May of 2012 and immediately
                        began seeking rescue for her. She had a huge tumor on her jaw, which they knew to be cancerous
                        and certainly painful and a questionable tumor on her thigh. A cage was no life for this
                        adorably sweet girl. </p>
